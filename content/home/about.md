# Biography

My research interests involve applying statistical reasoning to problems that bring together the fields of biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and statistics. I am especially interested in the development of statistical methodology for the analysis of high-dimensional genomic and transcriptomic data, and the implementation of such methods in open-source R/Bioconductor packages. My research is primarily focused on developing sound statistical methods for the analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, including differential expression analyses, co-expression analyses, network inference, and integrative multi-omic analyses. 

I'm currently sharing my time between my home lab in the [Animal Genetics and Integrative Biology](https://www6.jouy.inra.fr/gabi_eng/) (GABI) research unit in the [Animal Genetics](http://www.ga.inra.fr/en) division of [INRA](www.jouy.inra.fr/en) in Jouy en Josas, France and my host lab in the [AgroImpact](http://www.hautsdefrance.inra.fr/Le-centre-Les-recherches/Les-unites-du-centre/AgroImpact) research unit in the [Plant Biology and Breeding Division](http://www.bap.inra.fr/en/) of [INRA](http://www.hautsdefrance.inra.fr/) in Estr√©es-Mons, France.
