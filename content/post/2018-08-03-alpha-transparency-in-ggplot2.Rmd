#### tl;dr: Use `I()` to treat a numeric variable in a `data.frame` "as is" and avoid unintended conversion when mapping to transparency in a `ggplot2` aesthetic.

Today I ran into a `ggplot2` plotting problem involving mapping the transparency aesthetic to a numeric variable -- this drove me crazy until I figured it out.

Here's the basic set-up: I wanted to plot a scatterplot of two variables, but have the transparency of the points be controlled by a third (numeric) variable. I also happened to be using programmatic aesthetic mappings (`aes_string`) rather than non-standard evaluation of aesthetics (`aes`), so it took me a while to figure out whether the problem was related to this (it wasn't).

As an example, consider the `mpg` fuel economy data that is shipped as part of the `ggplot2` package. In order to play around with it, I'm going to add a few new numeric variables called `alpha_random`, `alpha_small`, and `alpha_big`. So when mapping transparency to each of them, I should get variably transparent points, extremely transparent points, and totally opaque points, respectively.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_bw())

data(mpg)
mpg <- mpg %>% mutate(alpha_random = runif(nrow(mpg)),
                      alpha_small = 0.01,
                      alpha_big = 1)
```

Next, a simple scatterplot between `cty` and `hwy` where I map the transparency to the `alpha_random`.

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 3.5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=alpha_random)) +
  geom_point()
```
So this seems strange -- my `alpha_random` variable appears to have been converted to a 3-level factor (as can be seen by the automatically generated legend to the right). But I thought `alpha_random` was numeric?

```{r}
class(mpg$alpha_random)
```

What if I force it to be numeric in my `ggplot2` call?

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=as.numeric(alpha_random))) +
  geom_point()
```

Weird -- no change. Let's see what happens when I use one of the other transparency variables I created.

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 6}
g1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=alpha_small)) +
  geom_point() 
g2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=alpha_big)) +
  geom_point() 
plot_grid(g1, g2)
```

Very weird -- they look exactly the same (and the same as before!), and there is still variable transparency being plotted, even though `alpha_small` and `alpha_big` are both constants. What is going on here?!? Transparency seems to work if it's specified outside of the aesthetic as a constant:

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.01) 
```

After some desparate Googling, I finally figured out that I needed to be using the `I()` function to change the class of my transparency variable to indicate that it should be treated "as is". (Note: given its short name, this was not an easy function to Google help for, btw!)

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 6}
mpg <- mpg %>%
  mutate(alpha_small = I(alpha_small),
         alpha_big = I(alpha_big),
         alpha_random = I(alpha_random))
g3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=alpha_small)) +
  geom_point() 
g4 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=alpha_big)) +
  geom_point()
g5 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, alpha=alpha_random)) +
  geom_point() 
plot_grid(g3, g4, g5, nrow=1)
```
Much better -- exactly what I was looking for! So the solution to my problem was making sure to change the class of the numeric variable in the `data.frame` to be used for transparency using `I()` to protect it from conversion.
