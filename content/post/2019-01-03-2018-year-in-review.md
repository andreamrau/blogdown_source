The start of a new year is always a nice time to look back and take stock of the past year, and look forward and set some goals for the coming year. I spent the entirety of 2018 as an [AgreenSkills+](https://www.agreenskills.eu/) Visiting Scholar at [UWM](https://uwm.edu/) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which has been (and continues to be!) a very rich experience that has given me the chance to broaden my understanding of statistical genetics and genomics and expand my skill set.

- I participated in several projects that were broadly focused on the integrative analysis of multi-omics data. In particular, we submitted and eventually [published](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty551/5047764) our work on the decomposition of gene expression variation into parts attributable to copy number alterations, methylation, somatic mutations, transcription factor expression, microRNA expression, and germline genetic variation in [cancer genomes](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/). In a collaboration with [Dr. Ava Udvadia](https://uwm.edu/biology/people/udvadia-ava/) at UWM, we also worked on a pretty cool short time-course analysis of matched RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data in a study on optic nerve regeneration in zebrafish; we hope to have a manuscript submitted in the early weeks of 2019. We [submitted](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01916941) our methodological work (and associated R package [*maskmeans*](https://github.com/andreamrau/maskmeans)) on multi-view cluster splitting and aggregation, which was illustrated using multi-omic (RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, methylation) breast cancer data. Towards the end of the year, we started work on a new project involving individualized pathway-specific analyses; tune in soon for more details on that. Thanks to my collaboration with [Paul Auer](http://people.uwm.edu/pauer/), I also learned a lot about the mechanics of GWAS and Mendelian randomization analyses, in particular for the large-scale [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and [TOPMed](https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/) resources.

- This was also a year where several recent collaborations all seemed to come to fruition at once, including 4 that were published, 1 that was accepted for publication, and 3 that were submitted.

- I gained a lot of new knowledge about [R](https://www.r-project.org/). In particular, thanks in part to prep work for the Data Management and Visualization class I taught at UWM last spring, I finally got a good handle on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ([*dplyr*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [*tidyr*](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)), web scraping basics ([*rvest*](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/)), creating and extracting information from SQLite databases in R ([*RSQLite*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html)), and creating [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps. I used my new Shiny coding skills to develop the [EDGE in TCGA](http://ls-shiny-prod.uwm.edu/edge_in_tcga/) app, as well as 2 internal apps with collaborators that we hope to publish early this year. In addition, I finally got around to vastly improving my website using [*blogdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

- I didn't travel nearly as much this year as I have in the recent past (but that was partially compensated by lots and LOTS of video conference calls). This wasn't entirely accidental, as I wanted to take the time to settle into life in Milwaukee after the very stressful move with my family from France in late 2017. I had a first trip out to San Diego in January for [PAG XXVI](http://www.intlpag.org/2018/), where I presented a talk on our [*coseq*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/coseq.html) Bioconductor package as well as work done for the [Fr-AgENCODE project](http://www.fragencode.org/). My main work trip this year was back to France in June to attend the final meeting of the [MixStatSeq](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/maugis/mixstatseq/) ANR grant led by my colleague [Cathy Maugis-Rabusseau](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/maugis), which also gave me the opportunity to reconnect with some of my [INRA](https://www6.jouy.inra.fr/gabi_eng/) colleagues. For personal travel, I got to see family and friends all over the country (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Michigan) and take a family camping trip in Southern California.

- Looking forward to 2019, I'll be offering a PhD topic on genomic prediction models that integrate functional annotation information starting next fall (so I'll have to get up to speed on that topic over the next few months!). I also hope to generally learn more about deep learning approaches (perhaps via a MOOC like the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) one or some more [R-specific](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/09/12/getting-started-with-deep-learning-in-r/) ones?) and how they can be applied to genomics problems. Some of the technical skills I'd love to acquire in the coming year include adding [Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/) to my R packages on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreamrau), continuing to develop more advanced Shiny coding skills, trying out the [*gganimate*](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) and [*purrr*](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) R packages, and maybe even trying to learn a little [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) for fun. On the teaching side, I will be helping instruct part of the Bioinformatics lab for the Physiological Genomics class at the [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu) this spring. I'll be heading to Brussels in April for the final [AgreenSkills+](https://www.agreenskills.eu/Annual-Meetings-Training) conference, and my sabbatical in Milwaukee will be winding down in the early summer. On a personal note, I am hoping to get another half marathon under my belt, go see [Hamilton](https://hamiltonmusical.com/chicago/), and travel to the Grand Canyon before leaving the States.
