I recently decided that I wanted to move my professional homepage from a free page set up on [WordPress](http://andrearau.wordpress.com) to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) by [Yihui Xi](https://yihui.name/en). 

There were basically two reasons for this: (1) Because I only sprang for the free WordPress site, there are gigantic, ugly ads that appear on every single page. I only recently realized this as I was usually viewing my WordPress site while being logged on -- and apparently, the ads only appear for other people. Needless to say, I found this very unappealing, but am also not willing to pay a huge subscription fee. (2) I love coding in R, and do a lot of my analysis work in reproducible [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents, and as such it seemed like it would be an easy move over to `blogdown` -- this means I would be able to maintain my website in R, have a lot more flexibility and control over the look of my website, and avoid those ugly WordPress ads. 

To set up my new GitHub Pages website, I found the following two blogs to be extremely helpful:

- https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/
- https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/

I basically went through the first link step-by-step to create my website. To summarize:

1. I created a new repository for my blogdown source content.
2. I installed Hugo using the `install_hugo()` function from `blogdown`.
3. I built the template for the new site using `blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic", theme_example = TRUE).
4. I changed the `config.toml` configuration file to set the `baseurl` to my GitHub URL using `baseurl = "https://<username>.github.io/"`, and I told blogdown which directory to place the rendered site in using `publishDir = "../<username>.github.io".`
5. Finally, I can create new content using the `new_post()` and `new_content()` functions from `blogdown`.
6. I can then render the site locally using `serve_site()`, and I can build the site using `build_site()`. After building the site and staging all changed files to both repsoitories, all that's left to do is commit changes and push the new site to GitHub.

For hosting it on GitHub, I used the second option from [this link](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/) -- namely, I have two repositories (including an extra one to store the source content and tell `blogdown` to publish the site to my `username.github.io` repository each time I build it, meaning I have to remember to push both repositories to GitHub when I make updates). The only other change from the tutorial I used was to add the hidden file `.nojekyll` to my `username.github.io` repository to make sure that GitHub does not rebuild the website using Jekyll.

As an addendum to this post, I also followed Ming Tang's [instructions](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/hugo-academic-theme-blog-down-deployment-some-details/) for customizing my website, primarily by changing the `config.toml` file. Notably, I changed the menu bar from white to black, added a CV section, and inactivated the selected publication and contact widgets.
