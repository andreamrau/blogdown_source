<p>I recently decided that I wanted to move my professional homepage from a free page set up on <a href="http://andrearau.wordpress.com">WordPress</a> to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> using <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> by <a href="https://yihui.name/en">Yihui Xi</a>.</p>
<p>There were basically two reasons for this: (1) Because I only sprang for the free WordPress site, there are gigantic, ugly ads that appear on every single page. I only recently realized this as I was usually viewing my WordPress site while being logged on – and apparently, the ads only appear for other people. Needless to say, I found this very unappealing, but am also not willing to pay a huge subscription fee. (2) I love coding in R, and do a lot of my analysis work in reproducible <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> documents, and as such it seemed like it would be an easy move over to <code>blogdown</code> – this means I would be able to maintain my website in R, have a lot more flexibility and control over the look of my website, and avoid those ugly WordPress ads.</p>
<p>To set up my new GitHub Pages website, I found the following two blogs to be extremely helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/" class="uri">https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/" class="uri">https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I basically went through the first link step-by-step to create my website. To summarize:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I created a new repository for my blogdown source content.</li>
<li>I installed Hugo using the <code>install_hugo()</code> function from <code>blogdown</code>.</li>
<li>I built the template for the new site using `blogdown::new_site(theme = “gcushen/hugo-academic”, theme_example = TRUE).</li>
<li>I changed the <code>config.toml</code> configuration file to set the <code>baseurl</code> to my GitHub URL using <code>baseurl = &quot;https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&quot;</code>, and I told blogdown which directory to place the rendered site in using <code>publishDir = &quot;../&lt;username&gt;.github.io&quot;.</code></li>
<li>Finally, I can create new content using the <code>new_post()</code> and <code>new_content()</code> functions from <code>blogdown</code>.</li>
<li>I can then render the site locally using <code>serve_site()</code>, and I can build the site using <code>build_site()</code>. After building the site and staging all changed files to both repsoitories, all that’s left to do is commit changes and push the new site to GitHub.</li>
</ol>
<p>For hosting it on GitHub, I used the second option from <a href="https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/">this link</a> – namely, I have two repositories (including an extra one to store the source content and tell <code>blogdown</code> to publish the site to my <code>username.github.io</code> repository each time I build it, meaning I have to remember to push both repositories to GitHub when I make updates). The only other change from the tutorial I used was to add the hidden file <code>.nojekyll</code> to my <code>username.github.io</code> repository to make sure that GitHub does not rebuild the website using Jekyll.</p>

<p>As an addendum to this post, I also followed Ming Tang’s <a href="https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/hugo-academic-theme-blog-down-deployment-some-details/">instructions</a> for customizing my website, primarily by changing the <code>config.toml</code> file. Notably, I changed the menu bar from white to black, added a CV section, and inactivated the selected publication and contact widgets.</p>

<p>As a second addendum to this post, I also decided to set up a custom domain for this website. I had previously purchased the domain (www.andrea-rau.com) through WordPress, without ever even really understanding how it worked. As it was coming up for renewal, I decided to transfer it to <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a>, which was a very straightforward process (I essentially clicked the link for “I’d like to transfer instead”, followed the instructions, clicked the appropriate link sent to my email, and voila!). Once I had my domain in my Google Domains account (it took a couple of days for the transfer to complete), the process for setting up the custom domain for my website was very easy – although I actually found the GitHub documentation to be somewhat hard to follow. I instead followed most of the steps listed <a href="https://medium.com/employbl/launch-a-website-with-a-custom-url-using-github-pages-and-google-domains-3dd8d90cc33b">here</a>, with the only exception being that I made sure to use the updated GitHub IP addresses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Add a <code>CNAME</code> file in the <code>MYUSERNAME.github.io</code> repository that looked like the following, and committed and pushed the changes to my repo:</p>
<pre><code>andrea-rau.com
www.andrea-rau.com</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In the Manage window of Google Domains for my domain, I clicked DNS and scrolled to the bottom to the <code>Custom resource records</code> box. There I added one <code>@</code> record of type <code>A</code> for the following four IP addresses, as described in the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/">GitHub Pages help</a>:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>185.199.108.153</code></li>
<li><code>185.199.109.153</code></li>
<li><code>185.199.110.153</code></li>
<li><code>185.199.111.153</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Then I added one <code>www</code> record of type <code>CNAME</code> for my GitHub Pages address, <code>MYUSERNAME.github.io</code>.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Finally, back in the Settings of my GitHub pages repo, I made sure to check the box for <code>Enforce HTTPS</code>.</li>
</ol>
